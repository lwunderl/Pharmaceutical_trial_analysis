Pharmaceuticals.ipynb will use Jupyter Notebook to load and merge data/Mouse_metadata.csv and data/Study_results.csv into a pandas dataframe for analysis.<br>
## In a dataset of equal mice per treatment regimen, which regimen achieved the most timepoints?<br>
Mice treated with Capomulin achieved the most timepoints in the dataset with equal number of mice per treatment regimen.<br>

## What was the reduction in tumor volume mm3 in mice at the final timepoint for the 4 treatment regimens with the lowest standard error?<br>
The four treatment regimens with the lowest standard error of the mean were Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin<br>
